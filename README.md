# hulkAppTest

In this project I have used laravel 7.0 version, and for authenticate I used laravel default auth.
Which we can achieve by following commands :-

1. composer require laravel/ui:^2.4
2. php artisan ui vue --auth

And for design purpose I used purple admin theme design.

In this project I have simply used laravel pagination and for Comments and Reply on comments I used ajax.

Pending Points :-
i. Users can also attach files in comment and task description.
ii. It should have automated tests for all functionality.
